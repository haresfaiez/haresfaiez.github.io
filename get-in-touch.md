Hello! My name is Faiez Hares. I am a programmer. I build software and I rant about software.
From time to time, I also complain about software.
I like to study programming languages and product design.
I am trying to get better at writing code and at figuring what code to write.
I enjoy running.
 
I will be happy to discuss ideas and to get feedback about my work; both online
or over a cup of cofee or a beer. I am also open to speak in meetups and conferences.
Here is my email address **{{ site.email }}**.
If you have something in mind, drop me a note and let's talk.
