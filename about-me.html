      <p> Hey there!</p>
      <p>
        My name is Faiez. I am a programmer. I put here my thoughts on software and
        I would like to hear your stories with what I write about.
        Click on that "Say Hi" button above to send me an email and write what's on your mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        I like backpacking.
        Checkout <a href="/where-to-go-next.html">my journey</a> and let me know if I missed a corner here or there,
        or if there are places I should visit next.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can find me on:
        {% include contact.html %}
      </p>
