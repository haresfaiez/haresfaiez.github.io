It all started when the quinqueremes took over the Mediterranean.
The Greeks tried to model human reasoning.
They laid the foundation of logic.
Leibniz, Bool, Hilbert, and many others later,
starting from those foundations, made the progress toward higher-order logic.
But, None of these advancements mirror human reasoning.

Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace, on the other side of Europe, wanted
also to imitate human reasoning.
They tried to outsource repetitive tasks to machines.
They focused on automating the resolution of sophisticated equations using
simple logical instructions.
Using the means at the time, they built machines based on mechanical engines.
Those early computers worked through manual labor.

Since then, people started looking for machines that not only
follow mechanically-encoded processes
but also interpret descriptions of which processes to follow.
Alan Turing described an automaton that answers this.
He specified a set of rules. If a machine follows them, it will be able to execute
any list of logical instructions.

When the transistors appeared and the gap between logic and electronics collapsed,
Von Neumann and his contemporaries built approximates of what Turing imagined.
Computers today are the evolution of those attempts.

A series of inventions then led to bitmapped screens.
Visual output pushed people into thinking differently.
Douglas Engelbart and his contemporaries thought of the computer as an extension
and a magnifier for the human mind.
This philosophy led to early developments in graphical user interfaces, the
invention of the mouse, and the first drafts of the internet.

People at Parc a few years later doubled down on those efforts.
They designed software with concepts as close to how the human mind
models and understands the world as possible.
Those concepts can be changed with the same operations the human mind employs
to change its understandings and its models.

They wanted computers to reflect what's in people's minds.
Those simulations (as H. Simon calls them) allow them to visualize,
reflect, enrich, and improve their thoughts.
They also offered flexible operations to imagine innovative ways of
manipulating the concepts.

Metaphors like "desktop", "window", and "scroll" appeared there.
We can put things (applications) on the "top" of the "desktop", but not under.
We can scroll in one of the four directions, but not in two directions at once.
We can have one application per window, but no more.

Apple, during its first years, recruited Parc's researchers and also
thought about computers as augmentation devices.
Steve Jobs said that computers are bicycles for the mind. Their effect
on improving human decisions will be similar to the improvement wheels had
on transportation.

In the 60s, computers were effectively automating repetitive tasks.
The motivation for replacing the human mind surfaced again
and the early attempts toward artificial intelligence appeared.
Today, they still get the most attention with evolution such as machine
learning and neural networks.

These are tiny glimpses of twisted tales computers like to tell their grandsons.
People with different motivations improved the state of the art.
Some tried to formalize and automate reasoning.
Others tried to outsource repetitive tasks.
Others thought about computers as mind amplifiers and tried to invent
new worlds to extend physical reality.

That said, today when you think of building or growing software.
You start with the aim of automating repetitive tasks,
replacing the human mind, or creating extensions that augment the mind?
