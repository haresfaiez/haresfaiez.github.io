##Mapping between source code and runtime behavior
- multiple view (UML, documenting software architecture)
- task-specific views?
- views are throw-away after use
- "clear the board" not "put it into the wiki"

##Attempts to "see" software
- diagrams/picture over code (cannot see the whole thing)
- but, we can see the next few steps
- the bigger picture (yep, we need may pictures there, or text)
- words can concentrate meaning (a box need too)
- two approaches ("query code" vs "draw pictures from code")

##Why the answer is not more than just "communicate more"
- communicate fail often
- shared understanding is hard to achieve (there are simply a lot of constraints)
- small deviation somewhere can accimulate over time

##The fallacy of communicating through code (the failure of the language)
- code is subject to syntactic rules (the praser needs to understand the code)
- put remainders in the code not explanation
- code should first compressed, than modifiable/queriable through tools, then readable.
