# Automated refactoring
We don't follow lint rules literally, so why

- automating refoctoring tools (write/narrow down a hypothesis first)
Automated refactoring: hypothesis about the shape after the refactoring and what might change  and the impact on the overal desing -> refactor -> check -> then get into the tdd cycle
