# Why not README
- README file is maybe suited more for proeject veterant who wants shortcuts
  for doing something (build, test, ..., but not for first-time users
- README is not interactive, and not designed carefully
- information design is one element of ux design
- understanding need a platform with rich interaction,
  like a web browser, you can go back in history, serach in web, open a new tab...
- one of the most important aspects of discovery is the path
- browser tabs/path in header helps you trace back

# What to visualize
- every javascript project should provide 'npm start' that:
  - needs no 'npm install'
  - gives a intercative ui/webpage that describe the project
- when you open your bank application, what you see is the polished
description of what the code does
- When you want to benefit from services of this app, you use the api
- explaining the code is coding?
