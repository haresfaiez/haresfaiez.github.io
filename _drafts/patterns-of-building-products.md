# Learn about your tools before you start
Read a Rust/Erlang book to get familiar

# Learn you tools by doing
Do not over-invest in learning tools

# Keep three levels of todos
immediate - next - won't do in this version

# Start with a working skeleton
1-working skeleton
2-iterate over all parts (holistic improvements)

# Try to drive iterations from the UI

# Be consious of scope creeps
- do the easiest thing (do not handle costly cases, hard-code solutions, ..)
- add a todo (see 3.todos) and continue your task(s)
- take a break and think about alternatives/solutions

# Keep time look-around-and-improve sessions
Improve code without target feature/state

# Allocate regular time for free reflection
daily work for example

# Celebrate small wins

# Grow features with stories and examples
Use string length to check error view
